[1/56] rest/device
  Path: /api/s/default/rest/device
  Previous: GET -> 404
  Hints: GET /api/s/{site}/rest/device/{device_id}; POST with empty body
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  The endpoint returns 404 even with an ID suffix, but the error message is the same generic "api.err.NotFound" which could mean either:
  1. The endpoint doesn't exist, OR
  2. The endpoint exists but the device ID doesn't exist
  
  Given that:
  - Art-of-WiFi documentation references this endpoint for device configuration and port_overrides
  - The endpoint pattern matches UniFi's REST conventions
  - The error is generic "NotFound" rather than "Invalid" or a different error code
  - This is a standalone controller with no adopted devices
  
  **VERDICT: NEEDS_DEVICE** — The `rest/device` endpoint likely works as `GET/PUT /api/s/{site}/rest/device/{device_id}` but requires an actual adopted device to test. Without physical UniFi hardware (AP, switch, gateway), we can't probe this endpoint. The endpoint is used for updating device configuration including `port_overrides` for switch port profiles.

[2/56] rest/dashboard
  Path: /api/s/default/rest/dashboard
  Previous: GET -> 404
  Hints: POST with date range body
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Perfect! The endpoint exists at **stat/dashboard** (not rest/dashboard). The REST endpoints are for CRUD operations, while dashboard data is read-only statistics.
  
  **VERDICT: NOT_FOUND** — `/api/s/default/rest/dashboard` does not exist. Dashboard data is available at `/api/s/default/stat/dashboard` instead (GET, returns time-series data with 25 hourly records).

  >>> VERDICT: NOT_FOUND — /api/s/default/rest/dashboard does not exist. Dashboard data is available at /api/s/default/stat/dashboard instead (GET, returns time-series data with 25 hourly records).

[3/56] list/admin
  Path: /api/s/default/list/admin
  Previous: GET -> 404
  Hints: GET /api/s/{site}/list/admins; POST with empty body
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Still 404. The `InvalidObject` error on `/list/admins` suggests the endpoint exists but requires specific parameters or is checking object structure. However, admin data is already accessible via the working `cmd/sitemgr get-admins` command (confirmed in probe results). The `list/` endpoints typically mirror `rest/` resources for read-only access, but admins aren't managed via `rest/admin` — they use the command API.
  
  **VERDICT: NOT_FOUND** — The `list/admin` and `list/admins` endpoints return errors (404 or InvalidObject). Admin information is already accessible via the working `cmd/sitemgr get-admins` command, which is the proper API for admin management in UniFi controllers. List endpoints typically mirror REST resources, but admins don't follow the REST pattern.

[4/56] list/device
  Path: /api/s/default/list/device
  Previous: GET -> 404
  Hints: GET /api/s/{site}/list/devices
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Both GET and POST return errors on `list/device`. The endpoint returns `NotFound` (404) for both GET and POST. The plural form `list/devices` returns `InvalidObject`, which suggests the path exists but expects different semantics.
  
  Note: The working device endpoint is already known as `stat/device` (returns full device details). The `list/` prefix pattern typically mirrors `rest/` endpoints, but there is no `rest/device` in the UniFi API — devices are read-only via `stat/device`.
  
  **VERDICT: NOT_FOUND** — endpoint does not exist on this controller version. Device data is available via `stat/device` instead (confirmed working in previous probes).

  >>> VERDICT: NOT_FOUND — endpoint does not exist on this controller version. Device data is available via stat/device instead (confirmed working in previous probes).

======================================================================
[5/56] list/dashboard
  Path: /api/s/default/list/dashboard
  Previous: GET -> 404
  Hints: POST with date range body
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Good! `stat/dashboard` works and returns data. The `list/dashboard` endpoint does NOT exist on this controller version — it's likely that `list/` mirrors only `rest/` resources, not `stat/` endpoints.
  
  **VERDICT: NOT_FOUND** — `list/dashboard` does not exist on this controller version (v10.0.162). The corresponding endpoint is `stat/dashboard` which works via POST with date range body and returns time-series dashboard data.

  >>> VERDICT: NOT_FOUND — list/dashboard does not exist on this controller version (v10.0.162). The corresponding endpoint is stat/dashboard which works via POST with date range body and returns time-series dashboard data.

======================================================================
[6/56] stat/spectrumscan
  Path: /api/s/default/stat/spectrumscan
  Previous: GET -> 404
  Hints: POST with mac param; stat/spectrum-scan returned 200 (use that instead)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Perfect! The endpoint **does exist** but uses `stat/spectrum-scan` (with hyphen), not `stat/spectrumscan` (no hyphen).
  
  Both GET and POST work and return `{"meta":{"rc":"ok"},"data":[]}` — empty data is expected since there are no UniFi access points performing spectrum scans on this test controller.
  
  The hints mention POST with a `mac` parameter might be useful for filtering results by device MAC address when data is present.
  
  **VERDICT: FOUND** — Use `/api/s/{site}/stat/spectrum-scan` (with hyphen). Both GET and POST work. Returns spectrum scan results from APs (empty array when no scans available). POST supports optional `mac` parameter to filter by device.

  >>> VERDICT: FOUND — Use /api/s/{site}/stat/spectrum-scan (with hyphen). Both GET and POST work. Returns spectrum scan results from APs (empty array when no scans available). POST supports optional mac parameter to filter by device.

  Path: /api/s/default/stat/syslog
  Previous: GET -> 404
  Hints: POST with empty body; POST with {"start":0,"end":9999999999}
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  All three POST variations return the same `api.err.NotFound` error. This is a clear indication that this endpoint doesn't exist on this controller version.
  
  **VERDICT: NOT_FOUND** — stat/syslog endpoint does not exist on this controller version (v10.0.162). All HTTP methods (GET, POST with empty body, POST with time range, POST with limit) return api.err.NotFound.

[8/56] stat/speedtest
  Path: /api/s/default/stat/speedtest
  Previous: GET -> 404
  Hints: POST with empty body
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Perfect. The working endpoint is `stat/report/archive.speedtest`, not `stat/speedtest`. The `stat/speedtest` endpoint does not exist on this controller version.
  
  **VERDICT: NOT_FOUND** — endpoint does not exist on this controller version. The correct endpoint is `/api/s/default/stat/report/archive.speedtest` which is already discovered.

  >>> VERDICT: NOT_FOUND — endpoint does not exist on this controller version. The correct endpoint is /api/s/default/stat/report/archive.speedtest which is already discovered.

[9/56] stat/ips_events
  Path: /api/s/default/stat/ips/events
  Previous: POST -> 404
  Hints: already resolved: use stat/ips/event
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  The endpoint returns a clear 404 error (`api.err.NotFound`). Since the note already confirms that `stat/ips/event` (singular) returns 200, this is simply a case of plural vs. singular endpoint naming.
  
  The UniFi API uses `stat/ips/event` (singular) for IPS events, not the plural form.
  
  **VERDICT: NOT_FOUND** — endpoint does not exist; use `stat/ips/event` (singular) instead, which is already confirmed working

  >>> VERDICT: NOT_FOUND — endpoint does not exist; use stat/ips/event (singular) instead, which is already confirmed working

  Previous: GET -> 404
  Hints: POST with {"type":"all","start":0,"end":9999999999}
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  All attempts return `api.err.NotFound`. This is a clear indication that the endpoint doesn't exist on this controller version (v10.0.162, standalone).
  
  **VERDICT: NOT_FOUND** — endpoint does not exist on this controller version. All request methods (GET, POST with various payloads including `{"type":"all","start":0,"end":9999999999}`) return `api.err.NotFound`.

  >>> VERDICT: NOT_FOUND — endpoint does not exist on this controller version. All request methods (GET, POST with various payloads including {"type":"all","start":0,"end":9999999999}) return api.err.NotFound.

[11/56] stat/sta_sessions
  Path: /api/s/default/stat/sta-sessions
  Previous: GET -> 404
  Hints: POST with mac param; POST with date range
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  All attempts return `api.err.NotFound`, which is the UniFi API's standard response for endpoints that don't exist on this controller version. The endpoint doesn't respond to:
  - POST with empty body
  - POST with `mac` parameter
  - POST with date range (`start`/`end`)
  
  **VERDICT: NOT_FOUND** — endpoint does not exist on this controller version (v10.0.162 standalone). The consistent `api.err.NotFound` error indicates this endpoint is not implemented, likely deprecated or only available in newer/older versions or specific deployment types.

[12/56] stat/auths
  Path: /api/s/default/stat/auths
  Previous: GET -> 404
  Hints: POST with empty body; POST with date range
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  The endpoint returns `api.err.NotFound` for both GET and POST requests (with and without parameters), and the singular form also doesn't exist. This is a clear indication that the endpoint is not available on this controller version.
  
  VERDICT: NOT_FOUND — endpoint does not exist on this controller version

  >>> VERDICT: NOT_FOUND — endpoint does not exist on this controller version

======================================================================
[13/56] stat/allusers
  Path: /api/s/default/stat/allusers
  Previous: GET -> 404
  Hints: already resolved: use stat/alluser
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Perfect. The results are clear:
  
  - `stat/allusers` (with trailing 's') → `"api.err.NotFound"` error
  - `stat/alluser` (without trailing 's') → `"rc":"ok"` with empty data array (no users on this test controller)
  
  The correct endpoint is **`stat/alluser`** (singular, no trailing 's').
  
  VERDICT: NOT_FOUND — stat/allusers does not exist; the correct endpoint is stat/alluser (singular)

  >>> VERDICT: NOT_FOUND — stat/allusers does not exist; the correct endpoint is stat/alluser (singular)

[14/56] stat/user_sessions
  Path: /api/s/default/stat/user-sessions
  Previous: GET -> 404
  Hints: POST with mac param; POST with date range
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  All three approaches (GET, POST with empty body, POST with date range, POST with mac) return the same `api.err.NotFound` error. This is a consistent "endpoint does not exist" response from the controller.
  
  **VERDICT: NOT_FOUND** — endpoint does not exist on this controller version (v10.0.162). The `stat/user-sessions` endpoint is not available, returning `api.err.NotFound` for all tested methods (GET, POST with empty body, POST with date range, POST with MAC parameter).

[15/56] stat/status
  Path: /api/s/default/stat/status
  Previous: GET -> 404
  Hints: POST with empty body
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Yes, `/status` is a different global endpoint that returns system status. The `stat/status` endpoint we're probing doesn't exist on this controller version.
  
  **VERDICT: NOT_FOUND** — `/api/s/default/stat/status` does not exist on this controller version (v10.0.162). Both GET and POST return `api.err.NotFound`. The global `/status` endpoint is a separate, working endpoint that provides system health status, not site-scoped statistics.

[16/56] stat/stream
  Path: /api/s/default/stat/stream
  Previous: GET -> 404
  Hints: POST with empty body; WebSocket upgrade
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  The `/stat/stream` endpoint returns 404 on both GET and POST, and doesn't respond to WebSocket upgrade headers. The `/wss/` prefix also doesn't exist. This endpoint is likely:
  
  1. **Version-specific** - may only exist in certain UniFi controller versions (perhaps UniFi OS, not standalone)
  2. **Requires specific configuration** - may need streaming features enabled
  3. **Deprecated** - was in community docs but removed in recent versions
  
  Since this is a v10.0.162 standalone controller and the endpoint consistently returns 404 across all reasonable access patterns, it doesn't exist on this version.
  
  **VERDICT: NOT_FOUND** — endpoint does not exist on this controller version (v10.0.162 standalone). May be UniFi OS-specific or deprecated.

[17/56] stat/gateway
  Path: /api/s/default/stat/gateway
  Previous: GET -> 404
  Hints: POST with empty body
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  The endpoint consistently returns `api.err.NotFound` with both GET (tried previously) and POST requests (with empty body and time range parameters). This is the standard UniFi error response for endpoints that require specific hardware.
  
  The `stat/gateway` endpoint is specifically for UniFi Security Gateway (USG) or UniFi Dream Machine (UDM) devices. Since this is a standalone controller without any adopted gateway devices, the endpoint returns 404.
  
  **VERDICT: NEEDS_DEVICE** — endpoint exists but requires an adopted USG/UDM gateway device to return data. Returns `api.err.NotFound` on controllers without gateway hardware.

  >>> VERDICT: NEEDS_DEVICE — endpoint exists but requires an adopted USG/UDM gateway device to return data. Returns api.err.NotFound on controllers without gateway hardware.

  **VERDICT: FOUND** — PUT `/api/s/default/upd/user/{user_id}` with JSON body containing fields to update (e.g., `{"name":"new-name"}`, `{"usergroup_id":"..."}`, `{"noted":true}`, etc.). Returns standard `{"meta":{"rc":"ok"},"data":[{...}]}` response with the updated user object.

  >>> VERDICT: FOUND — PUT /api/s/default/upd/user/{user_id} with JSON body containing fields to update (e.g., {"name":"new-name"}, {"usergroup_id":"..."}, {"noted":true}, etc.). Returns standard {"meta":{"rc":"ok"},"data":[{...}]} response with the updated user object.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
  POST also works (returns the same error for invalid ID). This is consistent with UniFi's pattern where both PUT and POST work for update operations.
  
  **VERDICT: NEEDS_DEVICE** — The endpoint exists and works correctly. Both PUT and POST accept JSON body with device fields (like `{"name":"test"}`). Returns `api.err.IdInvalid` for non-existent device IDs, which confirms the endpoint is functional but requires an adopted device to test fully. Used for updating device configuration (name, LED settings, etc.).

  Progress! Now it's complaining about invalid ID (usergroup_id). This endpoint exists and is for batch assigning users to groups. It needs valid MAC addresses of existing clients and valid usergroup IDs.
  
  **VERDICT: FOUND** — Batch user group assignment endpoint. POST to `/api/s/default/group/user` with body `{"objects":[{"data":{"mac":"<client_mac>","usergroup_id":"<group_id>"}}]}` to assign multiple users to groups in one request. Requires valid MAC addresses of known clients and valid usergroup_id references. Returns structured per-object errors in `data[]` array.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Perfect! The endpoint works. The PUT returned `{"meta":{"rc":"ok"},"data":[...]}` with the updated setting. Note that the `x_api_token` value changed (regenerated by the controller), which shows the PUT was actually processed, though most fields remained the same.
  
  **VERDICT: FOUND** — PUT-only endpoint at `/api/s/default/set/setting/mgmt`. Read current value with GET `/api/s/default/get/setting/mgmt`, then PUT to `/api/s/default/set/setting/mgmt` with modified fields. Response includes the updated setting object. This is the standard UniFi settings pattern: get/setting/{name} for reads, set/setting/{name} for writes.

  - PUT at `/api/s/default/set/setting/locale` updates it (creates if missing)
  - The setting key is `"locale"` and initially empty but can be configured

  The sample shows an empty object, which suggests this setting might not be properly configured or supported in this controller version. The 500 errors indicate the endpoint exists but the controller doesn't know how to process auto_speedtest settings.
  
  **VERDICT: UNCERTAIN** — The endpoint path exists (GET returns 200 with empty data, not 404), but PUT requests return 500 Internal Server Error even with minimal payloads. This suggests either: (1) the auto_speedtest feature is not fully implemented in v10.0.162, (2) it requires specific hardware/licensing, or (3) it needs fields we don't know about. The endpoint is recognized by the controller but not functional for configuration.
