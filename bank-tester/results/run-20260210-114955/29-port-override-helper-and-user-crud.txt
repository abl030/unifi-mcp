The delete operation consistently fails. This appears to be an API limitation - the user resource may not support DELETE operations even though it was probed. Let me generate the final report:

```
---TASK-REPORT-START---
task_id: 29-port-override-helper-and-user-crud
status: partial
total_tool_calls: 10
first_attempt_failures: 2
details:
  - tool: mcp__unifi__unifi_set_port_override
    attempt: 1
    params: device_id=dummy_device_id, port_idx=1, name=bt_sys29_port, confirm=true
    error: UniFi API error on GET /api/s/default/rest/device/dummy_device_id: api.err.NotFound
    diagnosis: Expected failure - no adopted devices in test environment. The tool works correctly by attempting to fetch the device first.
    retry_params: N/A - this is hardware-dependent and expected to fail
    retry_success: false
    category: hardware_dependent
  - tool: mcp__unifi__unifi_delete_user
    attempt: 1
    params: id=698ab079de355a6ab1c2e53b, confirm=true
    error: UniFi API error on DELETE /api/s/default/rest/user/698ab079de355a6ab1c2e53b: api.err.NotFound
    diagnosis: The API returns NotFound for DELETE even though the user exists and was just retrieved successfully. This appears to be an API limitation - users may be read-only or require a different deletion method. The tool is correctly formatted but the endpoint doesn't support deletion.
    retry_params: Retried with same params twice more
    retry_success: false
    category: unexpected_error
cleanup_complete: false
notes: |
  Port override tool correctly requires a device_id and fails gracefully when device doesn't exist (expected in bare controller).
  
  User CRUD mostly works:
  - Create: ✓ Successfully created user with MAC and name
  - List: ✓ User appears in list
  - Get: ✓ Retrieved user by ID
  - Update: ✓ Successfully updated name field
  - Delete: ✗ API returns NotFound even though user exists
  
  The delete failure is surprising - the user was created via the API and exists in the system, but DELETE returns api.err.NotFound. This may indicate:
  1. Users in UniFi are meant to be "noted" clients (observed on network) rather than fully managed resources
  2. The DELETE endpoint may not be implemented for the user resource
  3. The probe may have incorrectly inferred DELETE support
  
  Tool discoverability was excellent - all tools had clear names and parameters.
  
  Cleanup incomplete: User bt_sys29_user_upd (ID 698ab079de355a6ab1c2e53b) remains in the controller.
