notes: |
  All 8 network and device stats tools executed successfully on first attempt.
  
  Results summary:
  - routing_stats: 0 records (expected - no routes configured)
  - port_forward_stats: 0 records (expected - no port forwards configured)
  - dynamic_dns_stats: 0 records (expected - no dynamic DNS configured)
  - sdn_status: 1 record returned with full SDN configuration status (enabled=false, not registered/connected)
  - devices: 0 records (expected - bare controller with no adopted devices)
  - devices_basic: 0 records (expected - no adopted devices)
  - current_channels: 1 record with comprehensive WiFi channel data for US region including 6E, 6GHz AFC, 5GHz, and 2.4GHz channels
  - spectrum_scans: 0 records (expected - no spectrum scans run yet)
  
  Tool discoverability: Excellent. All tool names clearly indicated their purpose.
  Docstrings: Adequate. The current_channels and sdn_status tools had key field hints.
  Error handling: N/A - all calls succeeded.
  
  Notable observations:
  - current_channels returned extensive WiFi 6E channel data despite no devices present
  - sdn_status provided useful SDN/cloud connection configuration even without devices
  - Empty result sets had clear "Found 0 records" messages
  - No confirm gates needed (all read-only operations)
