Excellent! Both tools executed successfully with clear error handling. Now let me generate the task report.

  Both alarm archive tools executed successfully with appropriate error messages:
  
  1. unifi_archive_alarm (cmd/evtmgr archive-alarm): Returned "api.err.Invalid" for fake alarm ID
  2. unifi_alarm_archive (cmd/alarm archive): Returned "api.err.NotFound" for fake alarm ID
  
  Tool discoverability: Good. Tool names clearly indicate alarm archiving operations.
  
  Error quality: Clear. Both tools returned specific API error codes that distinguish between:
  - Invalid request format (api.err.Invalid)
  - Resource not found (api.err.NotFound)
  
  Key observation: These are two different endpoints (cmd/evtmgr vs cmd/alarm) with slightly 
  different error behaviors, which is expected given they're different command managers. The 
  naming distinction (archive_alarm vs alarm_archive) maps to the actual API structure 
  (evtmgr vs alarm manager).
  
  No actual alarms existed on the test controller, so testing with real alarm IDs was not possible.
  Both tools handled the fake ID gracefully with appropriate error messages.
