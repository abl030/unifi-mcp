notes: |
  All 10 tools functioned perfectly on first attempt. Dynamic DNS CRUD operations worked flawlessly with proper service, hostname, login, and password parameters. Tags CRUD operations also worked without issues, accepting an empty member_table array. Both resources were successfully created, listed, retrieved individually, updated, and deleted. Cleanup verified both resources were removed. Tool names were discoverable, docstrings were clear, and the confirm=True pattern worked as expected.
