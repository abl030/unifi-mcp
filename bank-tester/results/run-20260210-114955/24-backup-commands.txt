Now let me generate the structured report:

    error: UniFi API error on POST /api/s/default/cmd/backup: api.err.NotFound
    diagnosis: The cmd/backup manager with 'generate-backup' command does not exist on this controller version. The API returned NotFound, indicating this endpoint is not implemented.

    error: UniFi API error on POST /api/s/default/cmd/backup: api.err.NotFound
    diagnosis: Same as generate_backup - the cmd/backup manager does not exist on this controller. Both generate-backup and generate-backup-site commands route to the same missing manager.

  ## Backup Command Testing Results
  
  ### Working Tools (3/5):
  - ✅ unifi_create_backup (cmd/system backup) - Executed successfully, returned empty array
  - ✅ unifi_download_backup - Tool interface works, dry-run preview correct
  - ✅ unifi_delete_backup - Tool interface works, dry-run preview correct
  
  ### Failed Tools (2/5):
  - ❌ unifi_generate_backup - NotFound error on cmd/backup manager
  - ❌ unifi_generate_backup_site - NotFound error on cmd/backup manager
  
  ## Key Findings:
  
  1. **cmd/backup manager missing**: The controller does not implement the cmd/backup manager, causing both generate-backup and generate-backup-site to fail with api.err.NotFound. This is likely a version-specific limitation or requires specific controller configuration.
  
  2. **cmd/system backup works**: The unifi_create_backup tool (which uses cmd/system with the 'backup' command) executed successfully, but no backup file was created in list_backups output even after 13 seconds wait. This could be:
     - Async operation that takes longer than tested
     - Backup storage not configured in test environment
     - Controller missing prerequisites (disk space, backup directory, etc.)
  
  3. **Download/delete tools untestable**: Since no backups were created, couldn't test download_backup and delete_backup with real files. However, both tools show correct dry-run previews with proper command structure.
  
  4. **Tool naming clarity**: It's unclear from tool names alone that generate_backup and generate_backup_site use cmd/backup (which doesn't exist) while create_backup uses cmd/system (which does exist). All three sound equivalent from a user perspective.
  
  ## Test Environment Limitations:
  - Bare Docker controller with no backup storage configured
  - No persistent volumes for backup files
  - cmd/backup manager not available (version or feature limitation)
  
  ## Coverage: 5/5 tools invoked, 3/5 functional
tools_invoked:
  - unifi_list_backups
  - unifi_generate_backup
  - unifi_generate_backup_site
  - unifi_create_backup
  - unifi_download_backup
  - unifi_delete_backup
