The `unifi_list_sessions` tool is failing with `api.err.InvalidArgs`. According to the docstring, it "requires POST with {\"type\":\"all\",\"start\":0,\"end\":9999999999}", but the tool doesn't expose parameters for this. This appears to be a generator issue - the tool should either:
1. Hard-code these parameters internally, or
2. Expose them as optional parameters

Let me document this and complete the report.

  GENERATOR BUG FOUND:
  - unifi_list_sessions requires a POST body with {"type":"all","start":0,"end":9999999999} according to its docstring, but the tool doesn't expose any parameters to pass this data. The generator needs to either:
    1. Hard-code these parameters in the tool implementation when it detects this pattern in the docstring
    2. Expose type, start, and end as optional parameters
  
  EMPTY DATA OBSERVATIONS (expected on bare controller):
  - All client-related endpoints (list_clients, client_dpi, all_users, guests, authorizations) returned empty arrays - this is expected on a controller with no adopted devices or connected clients
  - site_dpi and dpi_stats returned single empty objects - these appear to be singleton stats that always exist but have no data yet
  
  DISCOVERABILITY:
  - Tool names were clear and easy to find
  - All tools that worked returned structured, parseable JSON
  - The docstring note about POST requirements was helpful but incomplete (didn't explain that the tool should handle it internally)
tools_invoked:
  - unifi_list_clients
  - unifi_list_client_dpi
  - unifi_list_site_dpi
  - unifi_list_all_users
  - unifi_list_sessions
  - unifi_list_guests
