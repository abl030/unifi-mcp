Perfect! The full CRUD lifecycle completed successfully. Let me verify the cleanup by checking if there are any remaining spatial records.

    params: {"name": "bt_sys32_spatial", "devices": []}
    error: API returned empty array instead of created object with _id
    diagnosis: The minimal data (only name + devices) caused the API to return empty array. Adding a description field resulted in proper response with _id.
    retry_params: {"name": "bt_sys32_spatial_full", "devices": [], "description": "Test spatial record"}
    retry_success: true
    category: missing_required_field
cleanup_complete: true
notes: |
  The spatial record fix (devices: []) works correctly. However, discovered that the API requires at least one additional field beyond name + devices to return the created object. When only name + devices are provided, the API returns an empty array, making it impossible to retrieve the _id for subsequent operations.
  
  The generator should update the docstring for create_spatial_record to indicate that while name and devices are the technical minimum, including additional fields (like description) is recommended to receive the created object in the response.
  
  Full CRUD lifecycle (create, list, get, update, delete, verify deletion) all worked correctly once a description field was added.
